A set is a collection of unique elements.
Several set implementations: HashSet and TreeSet.
HashSet represents the collection that uses a hash table for storage: Hashing is used to store the elements in the HashSet.
SortedSet interface provides a total ordering on its elements.
The access and retrieval times of TreeSet are quite fast.
The elements in TreeSet are stored in ascending order.
